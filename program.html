		<strong>Title</strong>
		Resilience of AI-driven Applications
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		The emerging innovations in computer science and engineering are being driven by a data driven  AI/ML promise to seamlessly and significantly augment human capabilities.  To be successful these systems must interact with other manmade and natural systems with a focus on the flawless capabilities of dynamic decision-making algorithms. Applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, robotic management and control, and enterprise scale computing - all driven by advanced data-analytics and artificial intelligence algorithms, have spawned a level of complexity where traditional methods cannot form the backbone for resilient and safe system design. Using data on operational failures of autonomous vehicles, surgical robots, and extreme-scale computing systems as examples, this talk will discuss features of our research that leverage probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) jointly with deep learning (DNNs) for building and validating a new generation of resilient and safety-critical AI applications.

		<strong>Bio</strong>
	Ravishankar K. Iyer is the George and Ann Fisher Distinguished Professor of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He holds joint appointments in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science, in the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL), the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. Iyer was an initial founder of the Information Trust Institute at UIUC—a campus-wide cyber-trust research center addressing security, reliability, and safety issues in critical infrastructures, including Power, Aerospace, and Financial domains funded by the State of Illinois, Boeing, HP, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and continues to serve as the Chief Science Officer. He leads the DEPEND Group at CSL/ECE at Illinois, with a multidisciplinary focus on systems and software that combine deep measurement-driven analytics and machine learning with applications in two essential domains: i) trust (that spans resilience and the security of critical infrastructures), and ii) health and personalized medicine. The Depend Group has developed a rich AI analytics framework that has been deployed on real-world applications in collaborations with industry, health providers, and government agencies, including NSF, NIH, and DoD. He has led several large successful projects funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Science Foundation (NSF), and industry. Professor Iyer is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). He has received several awards, including the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award and the 2011 Outstanding Contributions award by the Association of Computing Machinery. Professor Iyer is also the recipient of the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa from Toulouse Sabatier University in France.

	<h3>Yuval Yarom (University of Adelaide, Australia)</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Title</strong>
		Prime+Probe 1, JavaScript 0: Overcoming Browser-based Side-Channel Defenses
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		The “eternal war in cache” has reached browsers, with multiple cache-based side-channel attacks and countermeasures being suggested. A common approach for countermeasures is to disable or restrict JavaScript features deemed essential for carrying out attacks. This talk shows that blocking JavaScript features cannot prevent cache attacks. It presents a sequence of attacks with progressively decreasing dependency on JavaScript features, culminating in the first browser-based side-channel attack which is constructed entirely from CSS and HTML, and works even when script execution is completely blocked.

This is joint work with Ayush Agarwal, Daniel Genkin, Yarden Haskal, Lachlan Kang, Yosef Meltser, Prateek Mittal, Sioli O'Connell, Yossi Oren, and Anatoly Shusterman.

	<h3>Xingliang Yuan (Monash University, Australia)</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Title</strong>
		Secure Network Measurement as a Cloud Service
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		Network function virtualisation enables versatile network functions as cloud services. Specifically, network measurement tasks such as heavy-hitter detection and flow distribution estimation serve many core network functions for improved performance and security of enterprise networks. However, deploying network measurement services in third-party cloud providers raises privacy and security concerns. In this talk, I will present the design of our recent work named OblivSketch - a secure network measurement service built from Intel SGX. We harness the insights from confidential computing, large-scale network flow analysis, and data-oblivious primitives to build a secure and practical network measurement service. We integrate OblivSketch into the framework of SDN and demonstrate its performance via CAIDA datasets with millions of flows.

	<p>
		<strong>Title</strong>
		Dependability and Fault-Tolerance of Cooperative Mobile Robots: The Gap Between Theory and Pragmatism
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Speaker</strong>
		Xavier Défago (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan)
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		From an abstract viewpoint, groups/fleets/swarms of mobile robots can be seen as an extended form of distributed system where nodes are mobile and where they can interact through their actions on the environment. Due to demographic pressure on many world economies, robot and device coordination is bound to become gradually more prevalent in infrastructure-like systems over the next decades. As a result, it is becoming increasingly more important to ensure the dependability of such systems.
		In this talk, I will highlight the gap between theory and practice of fault-tolerance cooperative mobile robot systems. The first part of the talk will overview important theoretical results in cooperative mobile robotics and on self-stabilization. The second part will discuss multi-agent systems problems such as pickup and delivery and iterative multi-agent path finding. The third part will briefly discuss about Byzantine fault-tolerance in actual robot systems.

	<h3>Panel Discussion</h3>

	<p>
		<strong>Title</strong>
		Safety 2.0 - Safety in the next era
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Coordinator</strong>
		Nobuyasu Kanekawa (Hitachi, Ltd.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Panelists</strong>
		Masao Mukaidono (Meiji University),
		Masao Dohi (IDEC Corporation),
		Hiroo Kanamaru (Mitsubishi Electric)
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		Nowadays, holistic approach toward safety is demanded worldwide. In this panel session, the panelists introduce the concepts of Safety 2.0 which is newly proposed and including concept of collaborative safety in addition to the conventional functional safety.  Furthermore, the panelists discuss on how the safety (including ANSHIN and health) which leads to our wellbeing should be, and how should we realize it.
